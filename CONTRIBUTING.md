###### Tips:

:bulb: Before reporting an issue, make sure that it is in fact Blockzilla that is causing the issue. Confirm this by temporarily disabling other lists that you may be subscribed to (including the built in "Tracking Protection" in some browsers).

:bulb: Remedy any issues yourself instantly by simply disabling your ad blocker for the affected website.

## Notes:

:grey_exclamation: Blockzilla uses the Adblock Plus filter syntax and ideally should be used with Adblock Plus for the intended/optimal performance. However, Blockzilla can be used with other ad blockers that support the Adblock Plus filter syntax.

:grey_exclamation: **Untick the "Allow Acceptable Ads" checkbox in Adblock Plus:**

:one: Click on the red "ABP" icon.

:two: Click on "Options".

:three: Untick the "Allow Acceptable Ads" checkbox.

:grey_exclamation: **Still seeing some unblocked ads while using Blockzilla?** This is because in some cases I can't have access to certain websites to create ad blocking filters due to those websites having regional/country specific restrictions or require a login account (webmail, social media, etc.).
