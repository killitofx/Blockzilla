- Blockzilla is an advertisement and tracker blocking filter list subscription. Used with an ad blocking web browser extension such as Adblock Plus, Blockzilla makes you have a **better** web browsing experience.

- Blockzilla eliminates annoying and inappropriate advertisements, making websites load **faster**.

- Blockzilla also makes your internet browsing **safer** and more private by blocking tracking techniques that are used by most websites to learn about your online behaviour.

- Blockzilla is an unbloated and **slim list**, being light on system resources, yet still powerful against ads and trackers.
